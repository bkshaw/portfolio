# Intro

I am an AI Engineer at [Valuence Technologies Japan](https://www.valuence-t.com/) (VT). My work at VT revolves around building products using the latest AI algorithms helping to scale its business. Before joining Valuence, I completed my Masters in Signal Processing from the IIT Guwahati. I enjoy learning about the latest developments in Artificial Intelligence in my spare time. I am particularly interested in projects with social impact. If I can be helpful to you or your cause and would like to meet, please feel free to get in touch.

# Some history

- I was born into a simple middle-class family in December 1994 in West Bengal, India. My parents, who were not literate due to lack of opportunity, had high ambitions for my education.

- In my early years, I witnessed the hardships my parents faced to educate me. I have three siblings, and we used to study and play together.

- The turning point in my life came when I was 9 years old and lost my mother to cancer. At that moment, I couldn't fully grasp the magnitude of the loss.

- I remembered some of the last words my mother said to me, expressing her dream of seeing me educated. Her words have stayed with me to this day.

- From then on, I began taking my studies more seriously and consistently improved my grades year after year.

- In 2011, at the age of 16, I completed my 10th grade with a score of over 91.5%. One of the highlights was my Mathematics score, where I achieved 98 out of 100. I ranked 3rd in my school that year.

- In 2013, at the age of 18, I completed high school with a score of about 92.0%. Once again, the highlight was my Mathematics score, where I achieved a perfect 100 out of 100. I topped my school that year.

Ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.
