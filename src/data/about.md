# Intro

I am an AI Engineer at [Valuence Technologies Japan](https://www.valuence-t.com/) (VT). My work at VT revolves around building products using the latest AI algorithms helping to scale its business. Before joining Valuence, I completed my Masters in Signal Processing from the IIT Guwahati. I enjoy learning about the latest developments in Artificial Intelligence in my spare time. I am particularly interested in projects with social impact. If I can be helpful to you or your cause and would like to meet, please feel free to get in touch.

# Some history

- I was born into a simple middle-class family in December 1994 in West Bengal, India. My parents, who were not literate due to lack of opportunity, had high ambitions for my education.

- In my early years, I witnessed the hardships my parents faced to educate me. I have three siblings, and we used to study and play together.

- The turning point in my life came when I was 9 years old and lost my mother to cancer. At that moment, I couldn't fully grasp the magnitude of the loss.

- I always used to recall some of the last words my mother said to me, expressing her dream to see me educated and successful. Her words have stayed with me to this day.

- From then on, I began taking my studies more seriously and consistently improved my grades year after year.

- In 2011, at the age of 16, I completed my 10th grade with a score of over 91.72%. One of the highlights was my Mathematics score, where I achieved 98 out of 100. I ranked 3rd in my school that year.

- In 2013, at the age of 18, I completed high school with a score of about 90.50%. Once again, the highlight was my Mathematics score, where I achieved a perfect 100 out of 100. I topped my school that year.

- In 2017, I graduated with a degree in Electrical Engineering from KGEC in West Bengal, India.

- In 2018, I took the GATE examinations and qualified for admission to pursue a Master's at IIT Guwahati.

- In 2019, I completed an internship as a Machine Learning Engineer at Tata Consultancy Service in Chennai.

- In 2020, I finished my Master's degree in Signal Processing and Machine Learning. I truly enjoyed my studies as the subject encompassed Mathematics and Computer Science, which are my first and second loves.

- Also in 2020, after completing my Master's, I joined Valuence Technologies as an AI Engineer to develop products for the company.

- I have been working at Valuence Technologies for over 4 years, and during this time, I have made significant contributions to the development of many of its products and tools.
